# GifTastic
This is a website which uses AJAX to pull gifs from Giphy API when a specific search term is submitted. 
New search terms can be added dynamically. When a button is clicked, the text of the button is used as the search term. A limit of 10 gifs are added to the page, with a rating of g or pg, and in a still state. When a user clicks the image, it becomes animated. When it is reclicked, it becomes still again.
